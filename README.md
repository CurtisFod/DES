# DES
This is a working two way Data Encryption Standard that I designed In SystemVerilog. 
It include the DES, a DO file to run it in ModelSim, a test bench and a file of test vectors.

The DES takes in a Key and either a plaintext or a ciphertext depending on which setting 
you choose(encrpyt=0 or encrpyt=1), and it outputs a corresponding ciphertext or plaintext.

The file can be tested by using ModelSim or any other HDL simulation Software.

Have fun with it and please reach out if you have any questions, suggestions or comments.
